        have, I will not withhold from you. Whosoever would be chaste and modest; Allah will keep him chaste and modest
        and whosoever would seek selfsufficiency, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whosoever would be patient,

        father, Allah has called you back and you have responded to His Call. O father! Garden of Firdaus is your abode.
        O father! We announce to Jibril your death.'' When he was buried, she said: "Are you satisfied now that you put

        sorry) I did not know you.'' Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said, "Patience is (becoming)

        patience expecting the reward from Allah, and knowing that nothing will befall him other than what Allah has

        black woman, who came to the Prophet (PBUH) and said, `I suffer from epilepsy and during fits my body is
        exposed, so make supplication to Allah for me.' He (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) replied: 'If you wish you
        endure it patiently and you be rewarded with Jannah, or if you wish, I shall make supplication to Allah to cure
        you?' She said, 'I shall endure it.' Then she added: `But my body is exposed, so pray to Allah that it may not
        happen.' He (Prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ)) then supplicated for her." [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

        اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) replied, "Yes, I suffer as much as two persons.'' I said, "Is that because you have a
        double reward?'' He replied that was so and then said, "No Muslim is afflicted by a harm, be it the pricking of
        a thorn or something more (painful than that), but Allah thereby causes his sins to fall away just as a tree
        sheds its leaves". [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

        "Allahumma inni as'alukal-huda wat-tuqa wal-`afafa wal-ghina (O Allah! I ask You for guidance, piety, chastity
        and
        self-sufficiency)."

        who has taken an oath (to do something) but found something else better than that (which brings him closer to
        Allah), then he should do that which is better in piety (and he should expiate for the breaking of oath)".

        the Farewell Pilgrimage saying, "Be mindful of your duty to Allah; perform your five daily Salat, observe Saum
        during the month (of Ramadan) , pay the Zakat on your properties and obey your leaders; (if you do so) you will
        enter the Jannah of your Rubb".

        "O Allah! To You I have submitted, and in You do I believe, and in You I put my trust, to You do I turn, and for
        You I argued. O Allah, I seek refuge with You through Your Power; there is none worthy of worship except You
        Alone; that You safeguard me against going astray. You are the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects
        all
        that exists; the One Who never dies, whereas human beings and jinn will all die."

        of Allah
        Muhammad (صَلَّى اللهُ
        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) when he was told: "A great army of the pagans had gathered against him, so fear them". But
        this (warning) only increased him and the Muslims in Faith and they said: "Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us,
        and He
        is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)".

        the
        morning and return with full belly at dusk".

        whenever I go to bed: "Allahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa wajjahtu wajhi ilaika, wa fawwadtu amri ilaika,
        wal-ja'tu
        zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, la malja wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Amantu bikitabikal-ladhi
        anzalta,
        wa nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta (O Allah! I have submitted myself to You, I have turned my face to You, entrusted my
        affairs to You; and committed my back to You out of desire for You and fear of You; expecting Your reward and
        fearing Your punishment). There is no refuge and no place of safety from You but with You. I believe in the Book
        You have revealed and in the Prophet You have sent.'' Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللهُ
        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said that if anyone recited these
        words and died that night, he would die in the true religion. In case he remains alive till morning, he will
        obtain
        good.

        cave of Thaur and I saw the feet of the polytheists who were above us at the mouth of the cave (on the eve of
        the
        Emigration), I submitted: "O Messenger of Allah! If one of them were to look down below his feet, he would see
        us". He (صَلَّى اللهُ

        One of them used to attend the Prophet's circle (to acquire knowledge) and the other used to earn their living).
        Once
        the latter complained to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ
        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) against the former (for not earning his living). He (صَلَّى اللهُ

        actions.'' Someone asked, "Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?'' He (صَلَّى اللهُ

        good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. A man would be
        a
        believer in the morning and turn to disbelief in the evening, or he would be a believer in the evening and turn
        disbeliever in the morning, and would sell his Faith for worldly goods.''

        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ). He (صَلَّى اللهُ
        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) got up quickly after finishing the prayer with Taslim, and stepping over the
        people, went to one of the rooms of his wives. The people were startled at his haste, and when he came out and
        saw
        their astonishment at his urgency he said, "I recalled that there was left with me some gold which was meant for
        charity; I did not like to keep it any longer, so I gave orders that it should be distributed".

        Messenger of Allah, which charity is the most rewardable?'' He (صَلَّى اللهُ
        عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said, "That you should give charity (in a
        state when you are) healthy and stingy and fear poverty, hoping to become rich (charity in such a state of
        health and
        mind is the best). And you must not defer (charity to such a length) that you are about to die and would be
        saying:
        'This is for so-and-so, and this for so-and-so.' Lo! It has already come into (the possession of) so-and-so".

        deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.'' Then (giving a warning) he said, "Are you
        waiting
        for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion; or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or
        disease
        as will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or Ad-Dajjal who is

        thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming
        closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love
        him.
        When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he
        strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My
        Protection (refuge), I protect him".

        asking Allah for help and do not refrain from it. If you are afflicted in any way, do not say: `If I had taken
        this or
        that step, it would have resulted into such and such,' but say only: `Allah so determined and did as He willed.'
        The
        word `if' opens the gates of satanic thoughts".
